Student Management System

This C program demonstrates a basic Student Management System. The program allows you to create, display, append, search, update, and delete student records. It also provides options to sort records based on different criteria. The program utilizes a text file, "data.txt", to store the student records.

Features:

1. Create: Add new student records, including ID, name, and nilai (score).
2. Display: View all student records stored in the "data.txt" file.
3. Append: Add more student records to the existing data.
4. Number of Records: Display the total number of student records.
5. Search: Find and display a specific student's details based on their ID.
6. Update: Modify a student's name and nilai by providing their ID.
7. Delete: Remove a student's record by specifying their ID.
8. Sorting: Sort the student records based on total nilai, name or ID, in ascending or 9. descending order.
